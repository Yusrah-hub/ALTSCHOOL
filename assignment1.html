 My name is Seriki Yusrah. I was born on the 29th of November, 2008, and I am proudly from Lagos, Nigeria. I am currently a student at AltSchool Africa, where I am in my first semester studying Front-End Engineering.

From a young age, I have always been drawn to the beauty of nature and the joy of discovery. I enjoy spending time outdoors, going on picnics, travelling to new places, and immersing myself in books. I also deeply value rest, as I believe it’s an important part of staying balanced and creative.

During my secondary school years, I had the honour of serving as the Head Girl, a role that taught me leadership, responsibility, and the importance of teamwork. Academically, I achieved excellent results — I aced my O'Level examinations and earned a strong score in my JAMB, which helped pave the way for my current path.

My dream is to become a skilled and impactful Front-End Developer, building meaningful digital experiences and contributing positively to the tech world. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I look forward to the exciting journey ahead.
